# Tell-Me-A-Joke
This is a small website that tells users joke using JokeAPI.

* Use "npm i" in your terminal to install all dependencies before running the website. 
* Run the node application using "node index.js" in the terminal, once you have navigated to root directory in parent folder.
* Go to the localhost port address provided in the console, and have fun!
# How to run
The website is easy to use. Simply put a word in the search box, and the application will return a joke using that word.
